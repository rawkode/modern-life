Being a developer, programmer, analyst, tester, designer, etc … is hard. We work in an industry that champions the 12+ hour work day; continued learning and open source contributions, but not on the company’s dollar.

We’re continually berated with the idea of the 10x developer and so we must work harder, read more blogs, write more code and buy more books … but when will it ever end? Will technology ever stand still long enough to let us all catch up?

No.

You’ll always be busy, busy playing catch up in a race you didn’t sign up for. Fortunately, there’s another way. Instead of being busy, I can help you be more productive.

I will walk you through some of the tools and techniques that I use on a daily basis to, not only, maintain and upgrade my skills in the world of ever changing technology, but, and more importantly, to protect my sanity, be more present and remove stress and fear from my life.
