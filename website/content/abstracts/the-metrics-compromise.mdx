Your metrics are lying to you.

Throughout software history, we have been dependent on metrics to survive. Fate, it seems, is not without a sense of irony. Unfortunately, no one can be told what the Metrics Compromise is.

You have to see it for yourself.

This is your last chance. After this, there is no turning back.

You take the blue pill, the story ends; you wake up at your computer and believe whatever you want to believe.
You take the red pill, you stay in Wonderland and I show you how deep the rabbit-hole goes.
