Docker is a tool that allows you to package your application up into a single-runnable distributable binary. Docker allows you, a developer, to specify the exact environment your application needs to run, across development; test; staging; and production.

In this workshop, I will introduce you to Docker and explain its fundamental concepts. For those of you on Windows or OSX, I'll cover Docker Machine & Toolbox. We will then walk through creating containers, publishing and tagging images and getting started with the Docker Hub, all while covering some of the common pitfalls and awesome tips that Iâ€™ve learned during my own Docker journey.

Once the basics are established, we'll take a look at how Docker works and the kernel primitives that make it possible, followed by an interactive introduction to orchestrating containers with Docker Swarm.
