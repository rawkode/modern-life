title: 'What even is Cloud Native?'

The Cloud Native Computing Foundation, founded by The Linux Foundation, currently oversees the guidance of Kubernetes, Prometheus, OpenTracing, Fluentd, and more. The Cloud Native Computing Foundation describes being "Cloud Native" as three major components:

1. Containerized
   Each part (applications, processes, etc) is packaged in its own container. This facilitates reproducibility, transparency, and resource isolation.

2. Dynamically orchestrated
   Containers are actively scheduled and managed to optimize resource utilization.

3. Microservices oriented
   Applications are segmented into microservices. This significantly increases the overall agility and maintainability of applications.

In this talk, I will guide you towards taking your application cloud native, utilising the software available to us today, from the CNCF, and others, covering containers, tracing, logging and service discovery.
