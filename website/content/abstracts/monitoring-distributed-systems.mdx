The advent of Cloud Native architectures means our applications have become smaller and simpler, without any catches; right?

Wrong.

Migrating to microservices removes the complexity that comes with monolithic applications, allowing for faster builds, easier deployments, simpler domains, and more slices of pizza per team member; but where does all that complexity go? üßê

Our networks and infrastructure must mature and adapt to support our new distributed architecture. As we race to adopt containers, schedulers, and service meshes; we must remember to measure, monitor, and alert on our new problem domain.

In this workshop we will look at the challenges of monitoring distributed systems and how we can leverage time series databases for logging, metrics, tracing, and alerting.
