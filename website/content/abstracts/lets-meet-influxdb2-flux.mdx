Time Series Databases (TSDBs) have been the fastest growing category on db-engines.com for nearly 3 years, with InfluxDB being the number one TSDB since the categories inception.

As the leading TSDB, with over 300k (reporting) installations ... no company would ever halt development of their flagship product to build something new; right?

Let me tell you the story about why InfluxData, the company behind InfluxDB, took a massive risk and spent over 24 months:

- Rebuilding its database from the ground up
- Building an entirely new programming language for data processing
- Pivoting from Enterprise to SaaS

Did it work?
